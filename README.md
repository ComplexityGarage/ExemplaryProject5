# Modified lamp that turns on at the specific time

# Description of the project 
This project automates turning on a desk lamp at a specific time (e.g., 7:00 AM) using an Arduino. The motivation behind this project was the difficulty of waking up in the dark during winter. The system works autonomously without a computer and is powered by a battery pack.

# Science and tech used 
1. Arduino Board for processing
2. Battery Pack for independent power supply
3. Relay Module (5V control, 220V AC switching) to control the lamp
4. RTC Module (Real-Time Clock, DS3231) to track time
5. 3D-printed box
# State of the art 
The project is in its prototype stage and may be developed.
# What next?
For farther development, there are such possibilities:
Implemention a manual button to turn the lamp on/off at will.
Integration a light sensor to turn the lamp on only when the room is dark.
Adding a Wi-Fi module to enable smartphone control.
Incorporating a power supply from the 220V socket to eliminate battery discharge issues.
